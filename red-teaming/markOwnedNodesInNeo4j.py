# This script takes an input file containing Node names to be marked in Neo4j database as
#   owned = True. The strategy for working with neo4j and Bloodhound becomes fruitful during
# complex Active Directory Security Review assessments or Red Teams. Imagine you've kerberoasted 
# a number of accounts, access set of workstations or even cracked userPassword hashes. Using this
# script you can quickly instruct Neo4j to mark that principals as owned, which will enrich your
# future use of BloodHound.
